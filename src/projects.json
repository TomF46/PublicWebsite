The purpose of this application is to learn React Native and how it compares to other tech I have used such as Quasar, Ionic, and Cordova. Due to this I have tried to keep all development concentrated on visible elements such as design and user interaction and decided to mock the data with JSON as opposed to creating a real API though I may add this in the future.
